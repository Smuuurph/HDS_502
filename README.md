# How to use

Hi everyone welcome to my class python repository!

I highly recommend that you clone this and open it in DataSpell by JetBrains.
It is a premium IDE that you can get for free using your student account.

I highly reccomend that you create a virtual environment before using this code so
that you do not break your other python packages. Dataspell will set that up for you
if you get project from version control (VCS). After you have this project
cloned to your computer run `pip install -r requirments.txt` to install all of the 
exact python packages that I used. Beware this will overwrite your old python packages
unless you are in a virtual environment!!!
